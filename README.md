## My process

My intention was to build this page using as few tools as possible. I didn't want to use media queries, so I had to find a way to scale the elements according to screen size. See explanation below in "What I learned".

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS more effectively and economically. I'm proud of the following CSS code:

```css
.top,
.bottom {
  position: fixed;
  width: min(170vw, 800px);
}

.top {
  top: -20em;
  left: -25em;
  transform: translateX(10vw);
}
```

After positioning the circular background elements, I used "transform: translate" to move them according to the screen size. This way, the elements scale smoothly, without any media queries.

### Continued development

I need to continue exploring element positioning, as I feel I haven't yet fully grasped the interplay of differently positioned elements.
